 *  This demo will show you how to control a RobotGeek Pumping Station (or any other
 *  motor/pump via relay) based on input from a float switch. This will allow you to
 *  build an automated Aqurium refil pump, refilling your aquarium whenever it gets 
 *  to low.
 *
 *  Wiring
 *  Pin 2 - Float Switch
 *  Pin 4 - RobotGeek Pushbutton relay/pumping station 1
 *  Pin 7 - RobotGeek LED 
 *
 *  Control Behavior:
 *    If the float switch is not floating (i.e. empty tank) then turn on the pump and led
 *    If the float switch is floating (i.e. full tank) turn off the pump and LED
 *
 *  External Resources
